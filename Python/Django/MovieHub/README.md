# 🎬 Movie Hub
This project includes a movie recommendation system developed using Django. Users can filter movies based on certain criteria and get a movie recommended by AI. Users can also see the recommended movie's information and watch the trailer.

## 📝 Description:
Movie Recommender System Using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity:
In this project, the recommendation system recommends movies using a text-based similarity measure. Based on movie summaries, we transform the text of each movie into a TF-IDF vector. Subsequently, cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarities between these vectors. After selecting a movie that meets the user's specified criteria, the system identifies the most similar movies to this selection and presents them as recommendations. In this way, a system aimed at suggesting other movies similar to those the user enjoys is obtained.

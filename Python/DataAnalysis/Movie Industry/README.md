🛠 How to Run

Ensure:

      *Install Required Libraries:
          pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy scikit-learn
          
      *Download the Dataset (Movie Industry by DANIEL GRIJALVA on kaggle) and ensure that you have the 'movies.csv' dataset available in the same directory as your Python script.
          movies_df = pd.read_csv(r'path/to/movies.csv')
      *Copy and paste the entire script into a Python environment (such as Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or a Python script file). Run the script, and it will execute the provided analyses.
      *Check the Results: After running the script, you should see the output, including visualizations and analysis results. Make sure to review the printed information and charts to understand the relationships and analysis outcomes.
      *Adjust Paths and Parameters (Optional): If needed, you can adjust paths, parameters, or any other parts of the script to fit your specific requirements.

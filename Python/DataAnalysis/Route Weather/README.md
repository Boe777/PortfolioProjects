üõ† How to Run

Ensure:

      *Get your OpenRouteService and OpenWeatherMap API keys:
          OpenRouteService API key: Available from OpenRouteService.
          OpenWeatherMap API key: Available from OpenWeatherMap.
      *Install the required libraries:
          pip install openrouteservice plotly geopy
      *Start Jupyter Notebook:
          jupyter notebook
      *In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the "RouteWeather.ipynb" file by selecting it.
      *By running the Notebook cells in sequence (Shift + Enter), specify user inputs and run the program.
      *The program will generate a map display with the route and weather information between the start and destination points you specified.
      Note: You may need an internet connection for Plotly to work for the map display. Also, it is important that your API keys are valid and correct for this code to work properly.
